# Pins {.unnumbered}

The easiest way to publish a Pins board is to use the RStudio IDE to create an R file that contains the information needed to transmit data and "pin" it to the Connect server.

**Note:** The information below is taken from [here](https://docs.rstudio.com/how-to-guides/users/pro-tips/pins/) and adapted for the purpose of this guide.

## Prerequisites

-   `pins` R package installed
-   `rsconnect` R package installed

## Verify Connect server is registered

Connect servers which have been registered can be viewed by using the following command in an R console.
```markdown
rsconnect::servers(local = TRUE)
```
This will return a list of available servers.
```markdown
     name                   url                                   certificate
[1,] "colorado.rstudio.com" "https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/__api__" "" 
```
The __name__ value will be referenced later as <NAME> for publishing.

If no Servers are listed, follow the instructions in [Connecting Your Account](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/connecting/) to register your Connect server to your IDE.

## Create Content {.numbered}

### 1. Create a new R script named `faithful_pin.R`

### 2. Drop the following code into the file

```{.R filename="faithful_pin.R"}
# Establish connection to Connect server
board <- pins::board_rsconnect(server = "<NAME>")

# Create small data set
my_data <- faithful #for example

# Write data to server
pins::pin_write(board,
                my_data,
                name = "faithful_data")
```

Replace the <NAME> value with the server __name__ returned in the Verification step above.

## Publish Content {.numbered}

### 1. Run the script

Click on __Source__ in the IDE

__Source__ will execute the contents of the current file and you should see the following in the Console window"

```markdown
Connecting to RSC 2022.09.0 at <https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc>
Guessing `type = 'rds'`
Writing to pin 'roger.andre/faithful_data'
```

### 2. Verify content on Connect server

You should see the newly published pin set in your Content listing.

Click on the content and you should see information about the data listed.
