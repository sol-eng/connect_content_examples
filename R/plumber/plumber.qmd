# Plumber {.unnumbered}

The RStudio Docs have an excellent example [here](https://docs.rstudio.com/how-to-guides/rsc/publish-plumberapi/) of how to create a Plumber API and publish it to Connect.  However, a Plumber API can also be published using the `rsconnect` R package.

## Prerequisites

-   `rsconnect` R package installed

## Create Content {.numbered}

### 1. Create  `plumber.R` file in empty directory

```markdown
# plumber.R

library(plumber)
library(dplyr)

# Basic car data
df <- mtcars %>% select(cyl, mpg)
df$model <- row.names(df)
row.names(df) <- NULL

#* Return cars
#* @param cyl
#* @serializer json list(na="string")
#* @get /cars
function(cyl="all") {
  if (cyl == "all") {
    return(df)
  } else {
    return(df[df$cyl == as.integer(cyl),])
  }
}
```

### 2. Create `manifest.json` file

In R console, execute the following:

```markdown
> rsconnect::writeManifest()
```

This should generate a new file named `manifest.json` in your directory.

### 3. Verify content runs locally

If using RStudio IDE, click on __Run API__

You should see the Swagger interface for the API in the Viewer pane.

## Register Connect Server {.numbered}

### 1. Get API key from Connect server

### 2. Register the API key, account and server.

In R console:

```markdown
rsconnect::connectApiUser(account = "<ACCOUNT>", 
                          server = "<CONNECT_SERVER_IP>", 
                          apiKey = "<API_KEY>")
```

Should return:

```markdown
The account '<ACCOUNT>' is already registered; attempting to reconnect it.

Account registered successfully: <ACCOUNT>
```

## Publish Content {.numbered}

### 1. Deploy content to Connect server

```markdown
rsconnect::deployAPI(api = ".", 
                     account = "<ACCOUNT>", 
                     server = "<CONNECT_SERVER_IP>")
```

You should see the following after a successful deployment.

```markdown
[Connect] Launching Plumber API...
Api successfully deployed to http://3.16.161.212:3939/content/265f0df8-7e41-48c6-a1b1-2d5b599ff8ad/
```

### 2. Verify that API is accessible on Connect

Follow the link posted in the deployment pane. You should see the following.
