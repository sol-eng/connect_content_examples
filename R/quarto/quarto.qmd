# Quarto {.unnumbered}

Quarto.org has an excellent example [here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/rstudio-connect.html) of how to publish a Quarto doc and publish it to Connect.

Quarto documents can also be created in a text editor and published directly from the RStudio IDE.

## Prerequisites

* `quarto` R package installed
* Empty working directory

## Create Content {.numbered}

### 1. Create `quarto_R.qmd` file

````markdown
---
title: "Quarto Document"
author: "Roger Andre"
toc: false
format:
  html:
    code-fold: true
---
### This is some markdown:

* "Hello, world!"

#### This is some R code
`r ''````{r echo=FALSE}
summary(pressure)
```

`r ''````{r echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
title("Pressure Plot")
```

````

### 2. Verify the file renders locally

Open the file in RStudio and select the __Render__ option.

## Publish Content {.numbered}

### 1. Verify Connect server is registered

Press on the dropdown next to the "Publish" button and choose "Manage Accounts".

This will bring up a window that shows what Connect servers you are registered to publishing to.

If the "Publishing Accounts" area is blank, follow the instructions in [Connecting Your Account](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/connecting/) to register your Connect server to your IDE.

### 2. Publish

Once you have verified that you have a Connect server available to publish to, press the blue "Publish" icon in the IDE and then the "Publish"  button to publish to the selected server.

### 3. Verify content deployment

Look in the "Deploy" pane of the IDE.  You should see "Completed deployed execution" at the bottom.

````markdown
[Connect] Completed deployed execution
Document successfully deployed to https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/content/ac07b562-6ef5-486d-98f9-adbd5551c215/
Deployment completed: https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/connect/#/apps/ac07b562-6ef5-486d-98f9-adbd5551c215
````

### 4. Verify that content runs on Connect

The __Deployment completed__ link should look like this.
