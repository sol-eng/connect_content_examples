# Bookdown {.unnumbered}

The easiest way to publish a Bookdown site is via the Rstudio IDE, either using the desktop version or one of the server based products like Workbench or RStudio Server.  A built-in example of a simple Bookdown site can be created and then be published using the IDE's built-in "Publish" button. 

## Prerequisites

* `rmarkdown` R package installed

## Create Content {.numbered}

### 1. Create a new Project

Choose "File" --> "New Project" --> "New Directory" --> "Book project using bookdown"

We named ours, "Bookdown_Example"

![](images/2_bookdown_example.png){fig-align="left" width=50%}

This will create a new Project in a new directory named "Bookdown_Example" that contains all of the files needed to publish a minimal Bookdown site. In addition, 4 files will automatically be opened in the editor pane of the IDE: 

- `README.md`
- `index.Rmd`
- `_bookdown.yml`
- `_output.yml`

### 2. Configure "Preview" location

Select the `index.Rmd` file and click on the dropdown next to the "Knit" button.  Verify that "Preview in Viewer Pane" is selected.

### 3. Preview the site locally

Press the "Knit" button and you should see "A Minimal Book Example" displayed in the Viewer Pane on the lower right.

## Publish Content {.numbered}

### 1. Verify Connect server is registered

Select the dropdown next to the __Publish Application__ button and choose __Manage Accounts__.

This will bring up a window that shows what Connect servers you are registered to publish to.

If the __Publishing Accounts__ area is blank, follow the instructions in [Connecting Your Account](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/connecting/) to register your Connect server to your IDE.

### 2. Publish

Once you have verified that you have a Connect server available to publish to, press the blue "Publish" icon in the IDE and then __Publish website with source code__ button to publish to the selected server.

Select all of the files and the server that you want to to publish to and then press __Publish__.

### 3. Verify content deployment

Look in the "Deploy" pane of the IDE.  You should see "Site successfully deployed to <connect_server_address>" at the bottom, like this.

```markdown
[Connect] Completed deployed execution
Site successfully deployed to http://colorado.rstudio.com/content/6ed04778-cdb0-4a67-aaf1-2ed8ed814617/
Deployment completed: http://colorado.rstudio.com/connect/#/apps/6ed04778-cdb0-4a67-aaf1-2ed8ed814617
```

_NOTE: Successful deployment is not a guarantee that the the app can run.  Always verify that the content is running properly on the Connect server._

### 4. Verify that content runs

A browser window should open automatically to the address listed in the deployment message when you publish, or you can copy and paste the URL into a browser to check whether the content is successfully running in Connect.
