# Rmarkdown {.unnumbered}

The RStudio Docs have an excellent example [here](https://docs.rstudio.com/how-to-guides/users/basic/publish-rmd/) of how to create an Rmarkdown document using the built-in file creation tool and then publish it to Connect.

An alternative method is shown below which is code based.

## Prerequisites

-   `rmarkdown` R package installed

## Create Content {.numbered}

### 1. Create .Rmd file

Create a new file in a text editor named, `rmarkdown_example.Rmd` that contains the following code.
````markdown
---
title: "RMarkdown Example"
output: html_document
---
### This is an R Markdown document.

#### Pressure Data summary

`r ''````{r echo=FALSE}
summary(pressure)
```

`r ''````{r echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
title("Pressure Plot")
```

````

Open the file in RStudio

### 2. Verify the file renders locally

Press the __Knit__ button in the IDE. The rendered content should display in the Viewer pane.

## Publish Content {.numbered}

### 1. Verify Connect server is registered

Press on the dropdown next to the "Publish" button and choose "Manage Accounts".

This will bring up a window that shows what Connect servers you are registered to publishing to.

If the "Publishing Accounts" area is blank, follow the instructions in [Connecting Your Account](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/connecting/) to register your Connect server to your IDE.

### 2. Publish

Once you have verified that you have a Connect server available to publish to, press the blue "Publish" icon in the IDE and then the "Publish"  button to publish to the selected server.

### 3. Verify content deployment

Look in the "Deploy" pane of the IDE.  You should see "Completed deployed execution" at the bottom.

````markdown
[Connect] Completed deployed execution
Document successfully deployed to https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/content/ac07b562-6ef5-486d-98f9-adbd5551c215/
Deployment completed: https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/connect/#/apps/ac07b562-6ef5-486d-98f9-adbd5551c215
````

### 4. Verify that content runs on Connect

A browser window should open automatically to the address listed in the deployment message when you publish, or you can copy and paste the URL into a browser to check whether the content is successfully running in Connect.
