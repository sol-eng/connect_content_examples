# Evolution and Formats {.unnumbered}

RStudio Connect is an enterprise level publishing platform for interactive dashboards, applications, reports and APIs.  In 2014, when RStudio  released Shiny Server Pro v1.1, it had support for 2 types of content - Shiny and RMarkdown, both of which could only be worked on in R.  Now, in the current version of Connect, 2022.09.0, almost a dozen different content formats can be published from both R and Python.  

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| label: format_tbl
#| tbl-cap: "Connect Supported Formats"

library(gt)

formats <- read.csv("connect_formats.csv", sep=",") 
gt(formats) |>
  tab_options(row.striping.include_table_body = TRUE) |>
  tab_options(
     table.border.top.color = "black",
     table.border.bottom.color = "black",
     #Reduce the height of rows
     data_row.padding = px(2),
     #Adjust font sizes and alignment
     heading.align = "left",
     table.font.size = 10) |>
    tab_style(
    style = cell_borders(
      sides = c("left", "right"),
      color = "gray",
      weight = px(1.5),
      style = "solid"
    ),
    locations = cells_body(
      columns = everything(),
      rows = everything()
    )
  )
```

_NOTE: Connect Versions prior to 1.1 existed, but are not relevant to this guide._
